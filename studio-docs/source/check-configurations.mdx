> Before configuring check configurations make sure that schema checks are enabled for your data graph. See [Schema checks](/schema-validation/) to get set up.

**Schema checks** is a powerful tool to help you identify breaking changes before you make them, but we recognize that there are occasions when you might not care if there are breaking changes for a client that, for example, is used for ad hoc operations. Check configurations allow you to exclude clients you don't necessarily care about so that you can focus on the clients that do matter. Additionally, schema check configurations can also enable you to check against other variants of your data graph so that you can determine if your changes will break on other variants.

## Setting up schema check configurations

You can easily customize your data graph's check configurations through Apollo Studio in the Checks view under the Configuration tab.
> **Note**: If you have not set up check configurations for your data graph, the default configuration is always set to a time range of 7 days in the past and your checks will run against the base variant which is the variant of the schema you will be checking against.

The currently available configuration options are:
1. **Time range** -  Schema checks will run against operations that have been seen within this specified time range.
2. **Operation count threshold** - Exclude operations that have run fewer times than the specified threshold.
3. **Variant inclusions** - All operations seen on the variants selected will be checked against changes to the schema.
4. **Client exclusions** - Any operations sent by excluded clients will _not_ be checked against changes to the schema.
